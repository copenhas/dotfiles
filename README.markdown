Profiles

If you decide to use a full profile you might want to do a git checkout then just link the directories you want into your $HOME.

I have started this profile from scratch to try and learn more about customizing VIM. I'm trying to keep it somewhat organized and documented for any who want to learn from it. 

This will probably turn into a VIM environment starter kit of somekind since I haven't really run across any so far.
