Profiles
========

If you decide to use a full profile you might want to do a git checkout then just link the directories you want into your $HOME.

I have started this profile from scratch to try and learn more about customizing VIM. I'm trying to keep it somewhat organized and documented for any who want to learn from it. 

This will probably turn into a VIM environment starter kit of somekind since I haven't really run across any so far. For right now I want to focus on getting a Python and Ruby environment going. Possibly C#/Mono after that.

### Plugins Included:
General:

* pathogen - bundle style plugin management
* nerdtree - directory browing
* snipmate - snippets
* l9 - vim scripting library
* autocomplpop - auto-popup completion menu

Python:

* pyflakes - Python code checker (does error underline)
* pythoncomplete - Python code completion

### VIM Profile TODO
* Add all my references to this file for any follow ups
* Learn more about ctags and how to tie them into projects easily
* Python: Figure out what tester I want to use and tie it into the errorformat option...possibly makeprg
* Python: get ropevim in here for refactoring python
* Ruby: everything! (code completion, refactoring, errorformat/makeprg, real-time error squiggles)
* C#/Mono: everything! same as ruby
* Erlang: everything
